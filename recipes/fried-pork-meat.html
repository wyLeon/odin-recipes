    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It’s simple to make, but it is satisfying.</p>
    <p>
      Each bite paired a slice of pork with a strand of green garlic, whose mild
      sharpness cut beautifully through the rich, savory meat.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>10 ounces skinless pork belly (about 70% lean, 30% fat)</li>
      <li>2 ounces leek (about ½ medium leek) or Chinese green garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Pixian doubanjiang, chopped</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons douchi (preferably Tongchuan brand)</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the pork belly into thin slices, about ⅛ inch thick, cutting so that
        each piece ends up with striations from layers of fat and meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Trim the leek, slice it lengthwise, then cut it diagonally into
        approximately 1½-inch-thick pieces. Separate the white and light green
        parts from the dark green parts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat two tablespoons of oil in a wok or large frying pan over medium
        heat. Add the pork slices and salt. Cook for 6–8 minutes and stir-fry
        occasionally, until the fat renders and the edges turn crisp.
      </li>
      <li>
        Push the pork to one side of the wok. Lower the heat to medium-low and
        add the doubanjiang. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant and
        the oil turns red. Add the douchi and garlic and cook for another 30
        seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the white and light green parts of the leek. Increase the heat to
        medium and stir-fry for 1–2 minutes, until slightly wilted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the green parts of the leek and the sugar. Stir well to combine, and
        cook everything for 1 more minute. Season with more salt to taste, if
        needed, and serve hot with lots of rice.
      </li>
    </ol>
