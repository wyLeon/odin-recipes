    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      So the ingredients here are a cross between the cookbook’s mala crayfish
      recipe and its mala hotpot recipe
    </p>
    <p>
      Sichuan crawfish had to be just as fun and delicious. Enter: Mala Crawfish
      Boil.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup peanut or canola oil</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups dried Sichuan chili peppers 40 grams</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon whole red or green Sichuan pepper</li>
      <li>½ cup Pixian doubanjiang (chili bean paste)</li>
      <li>8 scallions, cut in sections</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ginger, sliced</li>
      <li>2 star anise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add ¼ cup oil to a large soup/stock pot and heat over a low flame. Add
        chili peppers and whole Sichuan peppercorns and stir-fry until fragrant.
        Add chili bean paste, scallions, ginger, star anise, bay leaf and any
        additional spices and cook briefly to bring out their aroma. Stir in
        yacai, preserved black beans and ground chilies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the 10 cups stock (or water or combination of the two), turn up the
        heat and bring to a boil. Add Shaoxing wine, sugar, ground Sichuan
        pepper and salt and mix well. Add the garlic cloves and celery and,
        finally, the live crawfish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil crawfish for about 3 minutes (or more if they are large). Turn off
        heat, cover pot and let crawfish soak up the spicy seasoning for about
        30 minutes. Fish crawfish out of the water to a serving platter and dig
        in!
