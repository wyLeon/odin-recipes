    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The peppers are seared in the wok on both sides until the skin is puckered
      and striped with black char like a tiger
    </p>
    <p>
      They are the perfect degree of done, being soft enough to eat but still a
      little bit crisp
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 medium-size or 2 large bell peppers</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon douchi (fermented black soybeans)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Chinese light soy sauce (preferably Zhongba)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Sichuan caiziyou (or other cooking oil)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Chinese black vinegar (preferably Sichuan Baoning)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Trim and de-seed bell peppers and cut each into 4-5 sections. Mix the
        preserved black beans with the soy sauce and sugar in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat wok until just starting to smoke, then add 3 tablespoons caiziyou
        (roasted rapeseed oil) and heat over medium-high flame until hot. Add
        pepper sections skin-side down and leave for a few minutes to char the
        skin until spotted or striped like a tiger, pressing down on the peppers
        with your spatula so they make good contact with the wok. Once they are
        charred, flip over and sear the other side. This process should take
        about 4 to 5 minutes. The goal is chilies that are cooked through but
        still have a bite to them.
      </li>
      <li>
        When peppers are well-striped, turn off the heat. Move the peppers to
        the sides of the wok with your spatula and add the preserved black bean
        mixture to the oil at the bottom of the wok. Cook briefly and mix well
        with the peppers. Add the vinegar to the wok and stir-fry just until the
        peppers are well coated with the sauce. Serve hot.
